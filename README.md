# BMTron
BMTron game based off a childhood version my sisters and I played on CoolMathGames.

How to Play:
Player 1 is blue and starts at the top left of the screen. Use W,A,S,D keys to move.
Player 2 is red and starts at the bottom right of the screen. Use I,J,K,L keys to move.

The game ends when one player collides into the edge of the screen or into the previous path of the other player.
